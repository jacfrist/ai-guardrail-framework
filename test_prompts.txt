Test Ordered By: Dr. Patricia Williams, MD, Board Certified Oncologist, License #CA-MD-789234, Medical Group: Pacific Coast Oncology Associates, Address: 2340 Medical Plaza, Suite 800, San Diego, CA 92101, Phone: 619-555-ONCO, Fax: 619-555-ONCK, NPI: 1234567890. Test Information: Test Type: Hereditary Cancer Panel - Multi-Gene Sequencing (83 genes analyzed), Laboratory: GeneDx Laboratory, CLIA #10D0988493, CAP #7139886, Lab Address: 207 Perry Parkway, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, Lab Director: Dr. Robert Chen, PhD, FACMG, Lab Phone: 888-555-GENE. Test ID: GT-9283746-2024, Specimen Type: Blood (EDTA tube, 10mL), Collection Date: 09/15/2024, Collection Site: Quest Diagnostics Patient Service Center, 4500 Genesee Avenue, San Diego, CA 92117, Phlebotomist ID: PH-78294. Received at Lab: 09/17/2024, Testing Completed: 10/15/2024, Report Date: 10/18/2024. Test Results: PRIMARY FINDING - PATHOGENIC VARIANT DETECTED. Gene: BRCA1 (Breast Cancer gene 1), Variant: c.5266dupC (p.Gln1756Profs*74), Classification: Pathogenic, Zygosity: Heterozygous, Inheritance Pattern: Autosomal Dominant, Detection Method: Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Clinical Significance: This variant is associated with significantly increased lifetime risk for breast cancer (approximately 55-72% by age 80) and ovarian cancer (approximately 39-44% by age 80). Also associated with increased risk for pancreatic cancer (3-5% lifetime risk) and prostate cancer in males (20% by age 80). This is a well-established pathogenic variant documented in medical literature and databases (ClinVar ID: VCV000055733). Additional Findings: 82 other genes analyzed showed no pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants detected. Two variants of uncertain significance (VUS) identified in CHEK2 gene (c.1100delC) and ATM gene (c.7271T>G) - clinical significance unclear at this time, insufficient evidence for risk assessment.
